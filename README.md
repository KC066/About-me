# Hi, I am Kuhoo 
Biotechnology Student | Genetics Enthusiast | Aspiring Researcher
# About-me
I am a Int M.Sc Biotechnology student with a string interest in understanding the genetics and molecular basis of neuodivergent disorders. I am particularly fascinated by how variations in gene expresion and neural pathways influence congnitive and developmental diversity

I am also exploring the interdisciplinary field of bio-optics, especially its application in studying neuronal structures, molecular interactions, and advanced diagnostic techniques.

My academic interests revolve around the combining biology, technology and research-driven problem solving to contribute toward better understanding neurological and genetic conditons.
